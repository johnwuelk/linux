in MEGAsync App
REMOVE ".*" from excluded file list (settings -> advanced), so that hidden files/ dotfiles are synced as well!

Also important - prevent MEGA from removing execute permissions on files:
MEGA settings -> Syncs -> Permissions -> Owner Permissions -> Check/set Execute for owner
if not set, cronjobs might fail because scripts cannot run!
