find out bluetooth model/driver:
  dmesg | grep -i bluetooth
output f.i.: BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb
get .hcd file of exact above output from https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware
and put it in /lib/firmware/brcm

or get Windows driver and convert from .hex to .hcd via hex2hcd https://github.com/jessesung/hex2hcd.git

-> reboot and enjoy with pulseaudio-bluetooth (if alsa is installed, pulseaudio has to be run first for bluetooth to work!)
pulseaudio-module-bluetooth has to be installed
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start

use utilities like bluetoothctl to test or blueman etc.
