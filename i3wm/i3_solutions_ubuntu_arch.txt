Ubuntu Minimal and i3

Brightness Screen / Backlight:
if things like xandr don't work install and use brightnessctl

Add to installs at the beginning:
sudo apt install software-properties-common

touchpad enable tapping(tippen):
apt remove xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
apt install xserver-xorg-input-libinput
if not already present: mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
folder /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d must only have the 40-.... file
in file 40-... under touchpad settings...
add the following 2 lines below driver "libinput":
Option "Tapping" "on"
Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
enable/disable touch via "xinput" command

Cursor themes: https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/cat/107/ord/rating/
lxappearance

For i3-gaps:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kgilmer/speed-ricer
sudo apt-get update #or just "apt install i3-gaps"

SOUND:
test sound f.i.  with
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Right.wav
Sund problems:
For sound to work, add user to audio group:
adduser john audio
Install pavucontrol
Select the "Playback" menu and make sure that you have it set to Show Applications

Add to line "load-module module-stream-restore" in /etc/pulse/default.pa: 
load-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false
killall pulseaudio
=> restart chrome or whatever program not outputing sound

or the following commands:
killall pulseaudio
rm -r ~/.config/pulse/*
rm -r ~/.pulse*
=> reboot

-------------
Microphone not working: easy - check in PAVUCONTROL
Configuration should be set to Analog Stero Duplex in order for microphone to show in the first place. Input Devices should list Microphone, play around with "Lock Channels" and "Set as fallback". These options are crucial for microphone to work or not. Also play around with alsamixer.
Test microphone:
arecord -f cd -d 10 /tmp/test-mic.wav
aplay /tmp/test-mic.wav
------------
Internal microphone not working
Make sure volume is enabled under 'Capture' view in alsamixer.
alsamixer: If 'Internal Microphone' is not displayed, press F4 then navigate to it and toggle it on (Space button).
command 'alsamixer -c 0' could make it appaear whereas 0 is sound card number, 'aplay -l' displays the card numbers.

-------------------------
SCREEN BRIGHTNESS Control:
install brightnessctl
IMPORTANT: user has to be in video group in order to work without root permissions:
sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
Then REBOOT is required in order to take effect

Get polybar working on ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-data libcairo2-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-ewmh-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev pkg-config python-xcbgen xcb-proto libxcb-xrm-dev i3-wm libasound2-dev libmpdclient-dev libiw-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpulse-dev libxcb-composite0-dev xcb libxcb-ewmh2

git clone https://github.com/jaagr/polybar.git

cd polybar && ./build.sh

---------
---------
find out classname of program for compton via 'xprop'

to find out right X11 keycode of key, type: xev
then type key or key combination (like Fn+F6) in the popup window.
---------
---------
Troubleshooting
If after reboot tty is shown instead of display manager/GUI:
Simply revert any changes made in /etc/X11/xorg...
This folder is very sensitive
---------
---------
Thunar Enable mount filesystem/partition:
change "auth_admin_keep" to "yes" under "mount a file system"
in file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.UDisks2.policy
---------
---------
set global alias in /etc/bash.bashrc
alias updateAllandClear='sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove'
---------
Power Button:
first disable power button (systemd):
activate
HandlePowerKey=ignore
inside
/etc/systemd/logind.conf
then bind key in i3 (code found out via xev):
bindsym XF86PowerOff exec "~/.Scripts/power.sh"
---------
If wifi does not activate by itself on startup:
sudo rfkill unblock wifi; sudo rfkill unblock all
to check that the card has been unblocked rerun:
sudo rfkill list
----
additionally on asus hardware:
append "options asus_nb_wmi wapf=1" in /etc/modprobe.d/asus-wifi.conf
if file does not exist, create it.
---------
To remove PPA, simply delete corresponding file
sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/PPA...
---------
---------
Printer Driver HP
the following packages should be installed
check via dpkg -p | grep ...
Main packages:
hplip
cups

The main packages should install the following ones, if printing doesn't work and some of them are missing, try installing them manually:
hplip-data, libhpmud0:amd64, libsane-hpaio:amd64, printer-driver-hpcups, printer-driver-postscript-hp, cups, cups-browsed, cups-bsd, cups-client, cups-common, cups-core-drivers, cups-daemon, cups-filters, cups-filters-core-drivers, cups-ipp-utils, cups-pk-helper, cups-ppdc, cups-server-common, libcups2:amd64, libcups2:i386, libcupscgi1:amd64, libcupsfilters1:amd64, libcupsimage2:amd64, libcupsmime1:amd64, libcupsppdc1:amd64, printer-driver-cups-pdf, printer-driver-hpcups, python3-cups, python3-cupshelpers, cups-core-drivers, cups-filters-core-drivers, ippusbxd, libchromaprint1:amd64, libgutenprint2, libqt5printsupport5:amd64, printer-driver-cups-pdf, printer-driver-gutenprint, printer-driver-hpcups, printer-driver-postscript-hp, python3-cupshelpers, samba, system-config-printer, system-config-printer-common, system-config-printer-udev
-------------------
-------------------
If Ubuntu too slow and too hot after suspend and resume:
sudo apt-get install msr-tools
sudo modprobe msr
sudo rdmsr -a 0x19a

If rdmsr does not give back 0 then:
sudo wrmsr -a 0x19a 0x0

RELIABLE:
install TLP, thermald. Tlp is for optimizing battery life and CPU performance.
modify /etc/tlp.conf or /etc/default/tlp for own needs and restart service. check documentation for further info at linrunner.de!

LESS RELIABLE:
Check if machine is running on performance or powersave:
install linux-tools-common, cpufrequtils and maybe more needed dependencies
cpufreq-info (f.i. "current policy...the governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use..." means it is NOT on performance)
If above command does not work: sudo cpupower frequency-info 
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance (set it to performance and check again with above command)

DISABLE Secure-Boot in BIOS for faster booting and hibernation if needed.

Playonlinux / wine MS Office 2013, PDF xChangeEditor, etc.
install everything via Playonlinux (NOT WINE), make sure anything Forms/.NET and any language options in installer is selected.
in "Configure Wine":
- Windows Version should be XP, not higher
- under libraries add msftedit, riched20, riched30, riched32, vbscript or vb6run
- set riched20 to only native (which should fix powerpnt issues)
Troubleshooting:
- Solution 1: Run in an emulated virtual desktop. This is probably the easiest solution for most users.
- Solution 2: Uncheck "Allow the window manager to control the windows" under Graphics in wine config. The downside is that Powerpoint will no longer show up in the taskbar.
Not sufficient memory/disk/ font error:
copy microsoft fonts into corresponding virtual drive (install ttf-mscorefonts-installer):
sudo cp /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/* ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/Office2013/drive_c/windows/Fonts
Or try with symbolic link to save space.
--------
Create link in file browser for easier access to home files:
ln -s target source
ln -s /home/do/ .PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/Office2013/drive_c/users/do/Favorites/HOME
--------
Shortcuts to applications are saved in .PlayOnLinux/shortcuts/
--------
If MSOffice should expire first try serial from serials.ws: 72RN3-HB2JJ-K9RF8-YVB3Q-628P9 or JNK2K-PJC3D-Y7DDR-J33RY-MY29K
-------------------
-------------------
Troubleshooting if update fails:
"...repository ... does not have a Release file."
Remove impeding ppa from /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ 
-------------------
-------------------
Autostart applications in LXDE:
desktop files of those applications in ~/.config/autostart, and they will get executed when the session starts. To use the lxsession autostart way, add a line with an @ followed by the command to be run to your ~/. config/lxsession/<profile>/autostart file.
-------------------
-------------------
Power management via xfce4-power-manager:
for screen lock to use i3lock modify or create /usr/local/bin/xflock4 because this is the file that xfce4-power-manager calls.
f.i. write "i3lock-fancy" in file.
Remove xscreensaver if installed!

Trying to show symbols in polybar (on arch):
yay -Ss siji-git unifont-utils ttf-unifont

list bindings of keys to virtual modifier names (for example Mod1 for Alt-Key, etc.):
