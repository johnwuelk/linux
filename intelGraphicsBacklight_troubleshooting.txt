Add following in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf (if not present, create it) and restart:

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Intel Graphics" 
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
EndSection


Reason: ACPI backlight is used instead of intel_backlight. this forces intel_backlight to be used.
brightness can then be set via xbacklight app
